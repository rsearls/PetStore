# PetStore

This is Sun's last release of the [PetStore](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/petstore1-3-1-02-139690.html) source code.
Pet Store was a sample application created by Sun for its [Java BluePrints](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_BluePrints) program.
It was Sun's official programming model for Java EE.  It demonstrated best practices for Enterprise Java development and became the the de facto source 
code for using EJBs and the latest components of the Java EE platform.

It's last implementation, version PetStore1.3.2, was for the Java EE 1.3 platform.  It used the [EJB 2.0](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_JavaBeans) 
programming model which is no longer supported by current Java EE platforms.  It was replaced by EJB 3.0 in the Java EE 1.4 platform.  Sun stopped maintaining this project in 2007.
